/*

Using Git:

- mkdir filename
- ls inside of it
- git init


Git only "saves" the changes and not duplicates of files

Commits:
- smaller changes makes greater commits
- smaller funcs make a more understandable commit message
- atomic (can't be broken down further) but varies on practice

Git checkout (to go back to a previous commit)

Branch:

- git branch dev

          /(Dev C) 
A => B => C => D => 

- git checkout dev (goes into the branch)
Master vs Main

- git diff dev  (to get the difference )


- git merge dev  (this will merge dev branch into main/ you have to be in main) 
Practice:
- Create a git repo
- Create a branch
- And then merge back into main
