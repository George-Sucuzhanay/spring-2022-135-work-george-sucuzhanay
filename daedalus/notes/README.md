# Starting a Development Cycle

- subgoal labeling

## Dev order:
- input
- output
- process

## Explorative coding

## The Mythical Man Math by Fred Brooks

## Top Down Development:
- writing a program in a high-level transitioned to a low-level
## Bottom Up Development (Agile Development):
- developing at a low-level to wrtie a higher-level program

## Clear func names and variables
- showing purposeful name to be used by others reading your code

## Testing
- You vs You 2 months are => implies you are always colaborating with someone
- documenting test cases allow for others to make sure your code runs all their tests
## Functional Programming

## Test Driven Developemnt
- looks like creating the test cases on Leetcode
- 1) Identify the problem
- 2) Create test case first before attempting to code anything

## CI/CD
